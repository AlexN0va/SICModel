# Segmented Image Compression Model

### As a programming intern alongside another programmer, I worked with a team of 4 high school students and 2 graduate student mentors to study the intersection between data compression and medical imaging. We created an intelligent compression algorithm and front-end web app to compress large MRI datasets. With our proof of concept algorithm, we achieved >50% compression with MRI's
